# Order Management System

This project consists of 3 Spring Boot microservices:
- `user-service`
- `inventory-service`
- `order-service`

Each service runs independently and communicates via REST. Built using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Docker, and tested with JUnit + MockMvc.

## How to Run

- Start MySQL
- Run each service on ports 8081, 8082, 8083
- Use Postman or Swagger to test APIs
